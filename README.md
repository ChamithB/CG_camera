üì± Project Overview: CG_camera
Repository: ChamithB/CG_camera

Purpose: The repository is intended to house an Android application developed in Java using Android Studio.

Current Status: The repository is in its initial stages, containing only a single directory (CG_Camera) without any accompanying code or documentation.

üîç Observations
Repository Structure: The presence of the CG_Camera directory suggests the initiation of an Android project. However, without further files or code, it's unclear what functionalities or features the application is intended to have.

Lack of Documentation: There is no README file or other documentation to provide context or instructions for the project.

No Code Commits: The repository contains only one commit, which adds the CG_Camera directory. No additional code or updates have been made.

üìù Recommendations
To enhance the repository and provide clarity for potential collaborators or users, consider the following steps:

Add a README File: Include a README.md file detailing the project's purpose, features, setup instructions, and any other relevant information.

Commit Code: Upload the actual source code of the Android application to allow others to view, use, or contribute to the project.

Provide Documentation: Offer documentation on how to build and run the application, including any dependencies or configurations required.

Specify License: Include a license file to inform users of the terms under which the project can be used or modified.
